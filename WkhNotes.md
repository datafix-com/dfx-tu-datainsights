The spreadsheet in the link below is a view of:
*	our known/planned expenses
*	revenue from invoices that have been entered into ITS
*	and anticipated revenue that is known and not yet in ITS as planned invoices

## I agree with Gsd that it would be very inefficient to work with preliminary numbers.
* From the point odf view of "significance", we should agree on the largest of the "Anticipated revenues"
* * As these converge with our agree with our other extimates, it should be more useful to review the system (without jumping to incorrect conclusions, based og preliminary values)
